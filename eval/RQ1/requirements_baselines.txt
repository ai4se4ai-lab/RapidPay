# Requirements for RQ1 Baseline Comparison Evaluation
# 
# These packages are required for running the baseline SATD detection methods.
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_baselines.txt

# Core dependencies (required)
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0

# Optional: For NLTK-based data augmentation (SATDAug)
nltk>=3.8

# Optional: For NetworkX graph features (GNN fallback)
networkx>=3.0

# Optional: For Hugging Face transformers (SATDAug, Flan-T5)
# Uncomment these if you want to use transformer-based methods
# torch>=2.0.0
# transformers>=4.30.0
# datasets>=2.14.0
# sentencepiece>=0.1.99

# Optional: For PyTorch Geometric (GNN full mode)
# Uncomment these if you want full GNN support
# torch-geometric>=2.3.0
# torch-scatter>=2.1.0
# torch-sparse>=0.6.17

# Note: When using fallback mode (default), only scikit-learn is strictly required.
# The baseline implementations automatically fall back to simpler methods when
# optional dependencies are not available.
